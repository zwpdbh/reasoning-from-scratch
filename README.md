In [*Build a Reasoning Model (From Scratch)*](https://mng.bz/lZ5B), you will learn and understand how a reasoning large language model (LLM) works.

Reasoning is one of the most exciting and important recent advances in improving LLMs, but it’s also one of the easiest to misunderstand if you only hear the term reasoning and read about it in theory. This is why this book takes a hands-on approach. We will start with a pre-trained base LLM and then add reasoning capabilities ourselves, step by step in code, so you can see exactly how it works.

The methods described in this book walk you through the process of developing your own small-but-functional reasoning model for educational purposes. It mirrors the approaches used in creating large-scale reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1, GPT-5 Thinking, and others. In addition, this book includes code for loading the weights of existing, pretrained models.

## Local Setup Notes (this fork) — Notebook Dev Experience

This fork uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and targets **Python 3.13**.
(3.14 currently breaks kernel-side tab completion: IPython → jedi → parso has
no 3.14 grammar yet; 3.13 also keeps the Appendix G `chainlit` extra working.)

```bash
uv sync          # creates .venv, installs all deps incl. dev tools
```

### Start JupyterLab

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

Launching via `uv run` means Jupyter runs *inside* the project venv, so the
default notebook kernel automatically has torch, transformers, etc.

### Editor features (autocomplete, hover docs, diagnostics)

The dev dependency group already includes `jupyterlab-lsp` + `pyright`, which
give VS Code-style static completions and diagnostics inside notebooks. One
manual step is required after every `.venv` rebuild: jupyter-lsp only detects
pyright in the npm `node_modules` layout, so we symlink the pip-installed one:

```bash
mkdir -p .venv/node_modules
ln -sfn ../lib/python3.13/site-packages/pyright/dist .venv/node_modules/pyright
```

After restarting `uv run jupyter lab`, pyright should be absent from the
"Skipped non-installed server(s)" log line.

User-level JupyterLab settings (apply to all projects on this machine):

- `~/.jupyter/lab/user-settings/@jupyterlab/completer-extension/manager.jupyterlab-settings`
  → `{ "autoCompletion": true }` — completions pop up as you type
- `~/.jupyter/lab/user-settings/@jupyterlab/codemirror-extension/plugin.jupyterlab-settings`
  → `{ "defaultConfig": { "autoClosingBrackets": true, "matchBrackets": true } }`
  — auto-close `()`, `[]`, `{}`, quotes; highlight matching pairs

(GUI equivalents: Settings → Settings Editor → Code Completion / CodeMirror.)

### VS Code notebooks (optional)

Register the venv as a named kernel, then pick it in VS Code's kernel picker
instead of letting VS Code install ipykernel into the system Python:

```bash
uv run python -m ipykernel install --user --name reasoning-from-scratch \
    --display-name "Python 3.13 (reasoning-from-scratch .venv)"
```

### Gotchas (this machine)

- The default package index is the Tsinghua TUNA mirror
  (`~/.config/uv/uv.toml`), which does not serve upload-time metadata —
  do **not** enable `exclude-newer` in `[tool.uv]`, or resolution fails.
- Model/dataset downloads from huggingface.co can be slow; use
  `https://hf-mirror.com/<org>/<repo>/resolve/main/<file>` with the proxy
  bypassed (`curl --noproxy '*'`), e.g. the chapter weights live under
  `rasbt/qwen3-from-scratch`.
- If locked dependency versions look mysteriously old after editing deps:
  `uv lock --upgrade-package <name> && uv sync` — `uv sync` alone reuses
  locked versions even after the original constraint is gone.

## Companion Book

Please note that *Build A Reasoning Model (From Scratch)* is a standalone book focused on methods to improve LLM reasoning.

In this book, we work with a pre-trained open-source base LLM (Qwen3) on top of which we code apply reasoning methods from scratch. This includes inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning, and distillation.

However, if you are interested in understanding how a conventional base LLM is implemented, you may like my previous book, [*Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)*](https://amzn.to/4fqvn0D).

## Hardware Requirements

The code in the main chapters of this book is designed to mostly run on consumer hardware within a reasonable timeframe and does not require specialized server hardware. This approach ensures that a wide audience can engage with the material. Additionally, the code automatically utilizes GPUs if they are available. That being said, chapters 2-4 will work well on CPUs and GPUs. For chapters 5 and 6, it is recommended to use a GPU if you want to replicate the results in the chapter.


(Please see the [setup_tips](ch02/02_setup-tips/python-instructions.md) doc for additional recommendations.)

&nbsp;
## Exercises

Each chapter of the book includes several exercises. The solutions are summarized in Appendix B, and the corresponding code notebooks are available in the main chapter folders of this repository (for example,  [`ch02/01_main-chapter-code/ch02_exercise-solutions.ipynb`](ch02/01_main-chapter-code/ch02_exercise-solutions.ipynb)).

For common problems, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md).

I welcome all sorts of feedback, best shared via the [Manning Discussion Forum](https://livebook.manning.com/forum?product=raschka2&page=1) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rasbt/reasoning-from-scratch/discussions). Likewise, if you have any questions or just want to bounce ideas off others, please don't hesitate to post these in the forum as well.

Please note that since this repository contains the code corresponding to a print book, I currently cannot accept contributions that would extend the contents of the main chapter code, as it would introduce deviations from the physical book.
